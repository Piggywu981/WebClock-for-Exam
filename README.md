# WebClock-for-Exam

A WebClock based on HTML and JS

Run by a simple click on index.html

To configure schedule, change *subjectlist* in *script/index.js*

My main focus is on [pythonServer](https://github.com/Piggywu981/WebClock-for-Exam/tree/pythonServer) now so it the main branch will be abandoned someday.
